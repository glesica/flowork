# Roadmap

In the future we could provide a local runner to allow running a task
inside its container through some other means, or running tasks using
unsupported container runtimes.

Load workflows and tasks using a meta manager so that they can be
stored on any supported medium.

## Ideas

 - Allow volumes to be reused (need to be able to clear them)
 - Need a way to warn when moving data between environments
 - Convert all paths to URLs immediately instead of using typed strings
